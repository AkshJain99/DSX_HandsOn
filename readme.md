#Classification Deck

* Testnotebook contains the Complete version of Basic IRIS data classification along with performance evaluation and algorithm comparision


* Classification Simple consists of a shortened version of classifier with no evaluation
	* IRIS data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

* MNIST Simple collects the required data itself when run for the first time and this project can be used to identify various handwritten digits and classify them into numerals between 0-9.
	* MNIST uses about 47000 images to train a Deep Belief network powered by Tensorflow running on DSX.On a regular computer, The training takes about 20 min to complete but DSX does it under less than a minute.
	* More Details on MNIST can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
